## About EISCAT_3D Data Solutions

The goal of the NeIC "EISCAT_3D Data Solutions" (E3DDS) project is to support the preparation of the implementation of EISCAT_3D for those aspects concerning e-infrastructure.
The project will design, simulate and prototype the data flow and computing workflow from the antenna arrays of the upcoming EISCAT_3D radar sites to the central storage and computing site.

EISCAT_3D is an environmental research infrastructure on the European ESFRI roadmap. It is proposed as an international research infrastructure using the incoherent scatter technique to study the upper atmosphere above the Arctic in order to investigate how the Earth's atmosphere is coupled to space. EISCAT_3D is a multi-static phased array radar system that will be installed at remote locations in the most Northern parts of the Scandinavian peninsula. The system will be operated by and be an integral part of the EISCAT Scientific Association. The e-infrastructure challenges for EISCAT_3D include finding cost-efficient state of the art solutions for on-site computing and establishing network connections between the different sites and with the data archive.
