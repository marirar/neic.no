Anja Wiesbrock started as NeIC Administrative Coordinator
===========================

The NeIC Office in Oslo grew stronger in August as a new person joined the team. Anja Wiesbrock takes on the diverse tasks of the Administrative Coordinator and becomes a member of the NeIC Executive team and PM-PO, the forum of Project managers and Project Owners.

Anja’s background is in EU law. She holds an LLM and a PhD in Law from the University of Maastricht in the Netherlands and has previously worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Oslo, Faculty of Law, and as an Assistant Professor in EU Law at the University of Maastricht. As a researcher, she has published numerous books and journal articles on different aspects of EU Law. She has also gained a lot of international experience, including working as a Visiting Researcher at Harvard Law School.

Since 2015, Anja has worked as a Senior Advisor at the Research Council of Norway (RCN) where she primarily focused on legal aspects related to international cooperation in research funding. Her work entailed, among other things, acting as a National Contact Person for legal questions in Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe, as the contact person for cooperation with South Korea and as a key legal adviser for Norway's participation in European partnerships. 
During her years at RCN, Anja has come across many questions related to data infrastructure, in particular Open Access policies in the EU and in Norway, data management plans and data protection. She has also been a part of a Legal Review Group of ELIXIR Norway and worked with legal questions related to international cooperation on research infrastructure on a more general level.

>*“I am excited to be joining NeIC and NordForsk and to contribute with my knowledge and experience on European and international research infrastructure cooperation to the facilitation of cross-border e-infrastructure collaborations in the Nordic region. I hope to be able to contribute to creating synergies between European, national and Nordic initiatives as well as to finding sustainable solutions for common challenges related to the cross-border sharing of e-infrastructure.”*

With her comprehensive background and skill set, Anja will be a great addition to the NeIC Office and Executive team. Her knowledge on related research communities and insight on the legal aspects of expanding cross-border cooperation are something NeIC has sought after and will benefit from in the following years. Welcome to NeIC, Anja!
