NeIC expresses interest in contributing to a competitive Nordic region
===========================

NeIC seeks continued long-term funding from 2023 by sending an expression of interest through NordForsk’s Open Invitation. This is a new approach taken by the national e-infrastructure providers in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden to continue the collaboration after the current long-term funding arrangements, which were set back in 2012, expire in 2022. 

## Aligning with The Nordic Prime Ministers' Vision for 2030

The Nordic Prime Ministers have a joint [vision for 2030](https://www.norden.org/en/our-vision-2030) of the Nordic Region becoming the most sustainable and integrated region in the world. To achieve this vision, the Prime Ministers have set three strategy areas that are prioritised: a green Nordic region, a competitive Nordic region and a socially sustainable Nordic region. Our plan is a concrete step towards the long-term vision. In particular, it supports the competitive Nordic region priority through our emphasis on digital infrastructure (e-infrastructure) for Nordic research excellence. 

Our proposed plan explicitly aligns with the Nordic Council of Minister’s action plan for 2021-2024 (Goal 8). NeIC will contribute to the development of advanced digital tools and services to enhance the productivity of Nordic research. Furthermore, our collaboration will accelerate the development of high quality and cost-effective e-infrastructure services across borders. 

We encourage the national research funding agencies in the Nordic region and Estonia to reinforce their support for our plan. Collaboration through NeIC offers the optimal layer to connect the national e-infrastructures, enabling pooling of skillful personnel and common development of future digital solutions for the Nordic research commons. 

## Aiming at securing NeIC’s future funding

A farsighted 10-year Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Nordic e-infrastructure collaboration was signed by heads of national research councils and NordForsk in 2013. To adequately support the Nordic Prime Ministers’ vision for 2030, it is critical that the national research councils and NordForsk renew the MoU for another ten years, appropriately extended to include Estonia and consistent with the political long-term vision. 

[NordForsk’s Open Invitation](https://www.nordforsk.org/open-invitation) is a common mechanism for joint research and research infrastructure activities within the Nordic region. It makes it possible for Nordic research funding organisations to propose new research programmes or extensions of existing programmes that will be administered by NordForsk but funded mainly from national sources. More information on the Open Invitation mechanism can be read [here](https://www.nordforsk.org/sites/default/files/inline-images/fgEKVb0bmosdICcrJ8RtB6CJULS41VeZ8LRk7QoaWVhxCVtWg0.pdf).

On February 13th, an expression of interest was sent to NordForsk, copying in all the national funding agencies to clarify our long-term goals and the framework for the funding we are seeking.

To better communicate our goals and principles, we have created a shortfilm presenting NeIC and translated it into all the six NeIC languages and English. You can find the video in your language [here](https://vimeo.com/showcase/7413599).
