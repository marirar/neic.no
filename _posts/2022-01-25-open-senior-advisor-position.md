Open position for a Senior Advisor
===========================

**NeIC is seeking a Senior Advisor at 50-80% to strengthen and renew its Executive team. The NeIC Executive team handles day-to-day management of NeIC, operates as a virtual team and is chaired by NeIC Director. Functions of the Executive team include strategy implementation, project ownership, project portfolio management, stakeholder management, funding applications management, impacts analysis and reporting, facilitating the work of the NeIC Board and related expert groups, communications and NeIC office management.**

The main goal of this position is to elicit international funding opportunities in the Nordic region and the EU with a focus on extending the opportunities for Nordic collaboration in new directions. This will involve engaging with prospective partners and consortia, interacting with key NeIC partners and networking with stakeholders. By expanding our capacity in this area, we aim to enable excellence in research, add value to the Nordics beyond national capabilities in e-infrastructure, increase competence and competitiveness in e-infrastructure and act as a global role model for e-infrastructure collaborations. The ideal candidate has excellent communication and collaboration skills, and for such a candidate we offer a wide variety of challenges which involve extensive contact with stakeholders such as research groups and specialist communities in the Nordic countries and internationally. Excellent command of English and travelling will be required. 

The start date for this position could be May 2022 or as agreed between NeIC and the successful candidate. It is anticipated that candidates are employed at a national e-infrastructure organization in one of the NeIC countries (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden), or a collaborating institution. For candidates that are qualified but not employed at one of the above mentioned organizations, NeIC offers to negotiate an employment relation. Staff are normally sub-contracted to NeIC through a service agreement between the national employer institution and NeIC, with the aim of enhancing Nordic collaboration.

Questions may be directed to NeIC Director Gudmund HÃ¸st, and applications including CV should be submitted to [openpositions@neic.no](mailto:openpositions@neic.no).
