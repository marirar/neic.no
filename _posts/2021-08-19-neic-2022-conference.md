The NeIC 2022 conference to be held in Oslo
===========================

The NeIC 2022 conference will be held in Oslo from 30 May to 1 June 2022. The conference has traditionally been arranged biannually, but due to COVID-19, the event had to be postponed from 2021 to 2022. As 2022 marks the 10-year anniversary for NeIC, the 2022 conference will be a celebration of Nordic collaboration and knowledge-sharing within e-infrastructure, bringing together experts, researchers and policy makers from all parts of the region. 

Arranging the biannual NeIC conference is a tradition dating back to 2013. The first NeIC conference was held in Trondheim and has since been held in three other Nordic countries. The feedback from the most recent conference held in Copenhagen was for the most part very positive: The location and logistics worked well, the programme was considered interesting and the social activities entertaining. As many as 85% of the feedback survey respondents reported that they were either satisfied or very satisfied with NeIC2019. In 2022, the event will return to the capital city of Norway, where the NeIC office is also located. The original plan was for the conference to be held in Reykjavik in 2021, but the pandemic forced the event to be postponed. Due to the traveling restrictions, choosing Oslo as the location was considered a safer choice.

2022 marks the 10-year anniversary for NeIC. It is also the year Norway holds the Presidency in the Nordic Council of Ministers and the chair for the Nordic prime ministersâ€™ meetings. These coinciding events offer us an opportunity to raise visibility and awareness of NeIC and how we are contributing to build a more competitive Nordic region. Some topics of potential interest to the political level include infrastructure for health-related data and the European Open Science Cloud.

The NeIC 2022 conference will be held in [Soria Moria Hotel](https://www.soriamoria.no/en/the-hotel/), Oslo. The aim of the event is to provide an opportunity for people in the e-infrastructure field to connect and collaborate with colleagues across the Nordics and to enable them to share knowledge and expertise and learn about interesting ideas and projects. In 2022, the theme of the conference is likely to be Open science and knowledge creation. More information about the event and how to register will be announced later.
