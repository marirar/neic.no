High number of applications for the 2021 Open call
===========================

The NeIC Open call for development projects is our key instrument for enabling Nordic research excellence through e-infrastructure collaboration. The 2021 Open call was launched on 14 January with a deadline on 10 March.

NeIC received 11 applications for development projects for the 2021 Open call. This is a record number of applications submitted for a NeIC Open call. In total, these 11 consortia applied for 104 MNOK of NeIC funding. The budget available for this call is 23 MNOK. The applications involve partners from all Nordics and Estonia, plus partners from seven other European and non-European countries. A decision can be expected in the June or September 2021 meeting of the NeIC Board. After a decision has been taken, NeIC will initiate contract negotiations with successful proposers with the aim of project start in early 2022. 

In addition, three applications were submitted for community-forming pre-studies and workshops. These are aimed at Nordic teams-in-formation to explore synergies of common e-infrastructure solutions and/or the potential to scope a future development project. A decision on pre-studies and workshops can be expected in April 2021.
