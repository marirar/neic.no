Open Senior Advisor position in NeIC’s Executive team
===========================

**NeIC is seeking a Senior Advisor at 80% to strengthen and renew its Executive team. The NeIC Executive team handles day-to-day management of NeIC, operates as a virtual team and is chaired by NeIC Director. Functions of the Executive team include strategy implementation, project ownership, project portfolio management, funding applications management, impacts analysis and reporting, facilitating the work of the NeIC Board and related expert groups, and NeIC office management.**

In this position, your work could include participating in project steering and portfolio management, engaging with emerging Nordic research communities with common e-infrastructure or open science needs and exploring Nordic opportunities for international collaboration. Many of the Executive team’s tasks involve extensive contact with stakeholders such as research groups and specialist communities in the Nordics and beyond. Your personal interests and competences would be taken into account when defining the exact tasks. The ideal candidate has excellent communication and collaboration skills, as well as experience within one or more fields relevant for e-infrastructure. Good command of English and some travelling will be required. 

The start date for this position could be October 2021, or as agreed between NeIC and the successful candidate. It is anticipated that candidates are employed at a national e-infrastructure organization in one of the NeIC countries (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden), or a collaborating institution. For candidates that are qualified but not employed at one of the above mentioned organizations, NeIC offers to negotiate an employment relation. Staff are normally sub-contracted to NeIC through a service agreement between the national employer institution and NeIC, with the aim of enhancing Nordic collaboration.

The full position announcement can be read [here](https://wiki.neic.no/w/ext/img_auth.php/1/1f/210614-Senior_Advisor_position_announcement.pdf). The deadline for applications is 15 August, 2021. Questions may be directed to NeIC Director Gudmund Høst, and applications including CV should be submitted to [openpositions@neic.no](mailto:openpositions@neic.no).
