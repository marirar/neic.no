NeIC seeks a manager for the NT1 activity
===========================
**NeIC is looking for an activity manager to lead the operations team that runs the Nordic distributed Tier-1 site for Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data storage and computing. This is a large-scale (>20 PetaByte) storage and computing effort that is part of a wider international infrastructure for storage and computing called Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG), which manages data on the ExaByte scale.** 

The main focus of the [NT1 activity](https://neic.no/nt1/) manager is to lead the distributed NT1 team towards operating a high-quality and sustainable Nordic Tier-1 service within the WLCG. This includes a range of tasks, from leadership, task prioritization to stakeholder engagement, but also classical project follow-up. The ideal candidate has excellent communication and collaboration skills, as well as expertise from development, deployment or operation of e-infrastructure services. Candidates are expected to have a genuine interest in developing skills in project management for distributed teams and in providing value-added services to researchers.

The contract period for this position is four years and will start as soon as possible. The activity manager is expected to commit 50% of a full-time equivalent to the Nordic Tier-1. It is anticipated that candidates are employed at a national e-infrastructure organization in one of the NeIC countries (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden), or a collaborating institution. For candidates that are qualified but not employed at one of the above mentioned organizations, NeIC offers to negotiate an employment relation. Staff are normally sub-contracted to NeIC through a service agreement between the national employer institution and NeIC, with the aim of enhancing Nordic collaboration.

If you are interested, please read the full position announcement [here](https://wiki.neic.no/w/ext/img_auth.php/c/c6/210628-NT1_activity_manager_position_announcement.pdf) and apply by 1 September, 2021. Any questions may be directed to either NeIC Director Gudmund HÃ¸st or NT1 Activity Owner Tomasz Malkiewicz. Applications including CV should be submitted to [openpositions@neic.no](mailto:openpositions@neic.no).
