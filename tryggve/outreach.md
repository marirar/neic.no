### Tryggve project outcomes and Final report

The main results of the project can be summarised to be establishing a Nordic offering of services for sensitive
data in biomedical research, and establishing a Nordic network of experts capable of jointly developing secure
IT services.
The Nordic offering is most visible as the continuous open call for Nordic use cases that the project were able
to advertise. The expert network is a significant outcome as it is not a given that enough trust can be built
across organisations and countries to be able to share expertise and discuss topics of IT security
implementations. Concrete outcomes from the project include the following:
* D1: Finland, Norway and Sweden have successfully deployed and established federated EGA Nordic
nodes along with creating the possibilities of deploying the SDA solution as a standalone.

4
* D2/D3: Established procedures for data and workflow mobility across the Nordic countries. The use of
container technologies have matured, and the establishment of common practices have made them
an invaluable tool in several of the D4 use cases. New technological solutions were developed
including SAPEIN that in the future will make it possible to exchange information between secure
clouds.
* D4: Within the use case program, a total of 24 use cases were supported. Four of these use cases
were concluded successfully solving technical issues associated with a scientific aim. Additionally, two
infrastructure use cases were concluded as well. Seven use cases did not reach conclusion, but
resources have been secured for their continued development.
* D5: Inventory of the federated authentication landscape and specifically helped make REMS compliant
with the GA4GH passport standard thereby making it feasible for use in a federated authorization
framework (i.e. Elixir AAI).
In summary, one can state that most of the objectives of the project were achieved and that significant advance
has been made towards offering sensitive data services in Nordic scale. Further proof of the success of the
project is that the project partners were willing to continue the collaboration and even agreed to increase
investment in it. As a result, two follow up projects has been initiated:
* NeIC PaRI project has started November 2020, directly following the Tryggve2 project.
* Heilsa “Tryggvedottir” project has been approved and is expected to start January of 2021
* Details on the project results are listed in the [project final report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WE7iB_PdXcSKcbUhQZLl2nnmR3bvxy2y/view?usp=sharing)

### Johanna Törnroos wins the best presentation award at Elixir AHM 2020 

Johanna Törnroos is the winner of the award for the best presentation at the Impact and Innovation Mini-
Symposium during the All Hands Meeting 2020. She presented ‘Impact through Collaboration’ in the Nordics
within The Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC) — from exchanging knowledge to increasing
competencies and research quality. She employed an example from the Tryggve2 Project, where NeIC
supports the development of sensitive data management tools used, among others, in assessing the risk of
heritable and familial cancers.

More details and a recording of the presentation can be found on [Elixir Europe website](https://elixir-europe.org/news/johanna-tornroos-wins-best-presentation-award).
